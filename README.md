# Final Project:
In this repository you can find Cristina Santa Cruz's solution for the final activity of the Front-End Development course (Level II). This is based on creating a form that allows to create a fictitious account to access a web page with the following aspect.

The validations that must be fulfilled are:
- All fields must be mandatory or else we will get an error.
- The Name field must be of type Text, any numeric character will not be admitted.
- The Email field must be of type "email" verifying that it is a real email by means of regular expressions.
- The Password field must be at least 8 characters long.
- The value entered in the Key and Confirm your key fields must be identical or an error will be returned.

If the validations are correct, they will be marked green and if they are not, they will be marked red.
Finally, if all the fields are correctly validated, when you click on the SEND button, an alert will appear on the screen informing you that the registration has been successful.
